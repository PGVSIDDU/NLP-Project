# MultiLingual-Document-Summarization
## Introduction
Welcome to the "MultiLingual Document Summarization" project! This initiative is dedicated to creating an automated system for multi-document summarization in both English and Arabic. By harnessing advanced language models and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for topic modeling, the project aims to bridge linguistic divides, enhance information accessibility, and improve efficiency in processing large volumes of textual data. Our ultimate goal is to deliver a powerful tool for efficient information retrieval and cross-cultural text analysis.

## Project Overview
In today’s data-driven era, managing and extracting insights from vast textual content is a significant challenge. This repository is designed to transform how large-scale texts are handled by providing a robust and automated multi-document summarization system for English and Arabic languages.


## Key Features:

1. **Bilingual Support:** Supports multi-document summarization in both English and Arabic, enabling seamless cross-linguistic information retrieval.
2. **Cutting-Edge NLP:** Incorporates state-of-the-art language models, LDA for topic identification, and other NLP techniques to generate concise, accurate, and informative summaries.
3. **Custom Dataset:** Uses a curated dataset from diverse sources to ensure quality and relevance in training and evaluation.
4. **Rigorous Evaluation Metrics:** Assesses performance using widely accepted metrics like ROUGE, BERTScore, BLEU, and Fluency to guarantee coherent and reliable summaries.

## Getting Started
To explore the MultiLingual Document Summarization system on Google Colab, follow these steps:
**Installation**
The project is designed for Google Colab, simplifying the setup process. Follow the instructions below to get started:

1. **Open in Colab:** Use the provided Jupyter notebook (.ipynb file). Click the link, and it will launch directly in Google Colab.
2. **Configure Runtime:** Ensure you have a stable internet connection and select a Python runtime with GPU acceleration for better performance.
3. **Load Data:** Download the English and Arabic datasets from the data folder and upload them to your Colab environment.
4. **Run Notebook:** Execute all cells by navigating to "Runtime" -> "Run all" in the Colab menu. This will automatically install dependencies and configure the environment.
